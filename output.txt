description</b></font></td>
<td></td>
<td>This course focuses on the issues encountered in building
Internet and web systems: scalability, interoperability (of data
and code), atomicity and consistency models, replication, and
location of resources, services, and data. Note that it is
<i>not</i> about building database-backed or PHP/JSP/Servlet-based
web sites (for this, see 
<!-- <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis330/"> -->CIS&#160;<a
href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis550/">450/550</a> or <a href=
"http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nets212/">NETS&#160;212</a>). Here, we
will learn how a Servlet server <i>itself</i> is built!
<p>We will examine how XML standards enable information exchange;
how web services support cross-platform interoperability (and what
their limitations are); how "cloud computing" services work; how to
do replication and Akamai-like content distribution; and how
application servers provide transaction support in distributed
environments. We will study techniques for locating machines,
resources, and data (including directory systems, information
retrieval indexing and ranking, web search, and publish/subscribe
systems); we will discuss collaborative filtering and mining the
Web for patterns; we will investigate how different architectures
support scalability (and the issues they face). We will also
examine the ideas that have been proposed for tomorrow's Web,
including the "Semantic Web", and see some of the challenges,
research directions, and potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>An important goal of the course is not simply to discuss issues
and solutions, but to provide hands-on experience with a
substantial implementation project. This semester's project will be
a peer-to-peer implementation of a Googe-style search engine,
including distributed, scalable crawling; indexing with ranking;
and even PageRank. We will also incorporate the use of
topic-specific recognizers and mash-ups.</p>
<p>As a side effect of the material of this course, you will learn
about some aspects of large-scale software development:
assimilating large APIs, thinking about modularity, reading other
people's code, managing versions, debugging, and so on.</p>

Brandon Krieger, Steven Krouse, Mitchell Stern, and Edward
Wadsworth built "70!", a cloud-based search engine. 70! consists of
1) a scalable distributed crawler that runs on Amazon EC2 instances
and uses FreePastry for coordination; 2) an indexer and a PageRank
engine that is based on Elastic MapReduce; and 3)&#160;a web
frontend. Hitchhiker can show previews of the results it returns,
and it supports voice-controlled search; as a special feature,
users can navigate the results by 'swiping' with their hands in
front of a webcam.</td>
